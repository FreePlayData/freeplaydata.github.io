  <emph>Setting</emph>
  On an internet ad exchange, advertisers and their agencies
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding"
     target="_blank">
    bid in real time
  </a>
  to display an ad, whenever an internet user loads content containing
  a site placement (e.g. a panel within a web site or app for showing
  ads.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieving a targeted quantity of impressions while
  minimizing cost, especially given preferences over user and
  placement combinations, is a moving target; bids must be high enough
  to win auctions, but low enough to conserve
  spending.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the optimal bidding strategy changes
  constantly according to the actions and reactions of thousands of
  other automated bidding agents.

<br>

<div class="project-step">
  <emph>Requirements</emph> Bidding agent must minimize cost per
  impression (eCPM) while meeting advertiser's purchase order for ad
  to appear a mandatory number of times, distributed evenly over a
  specified number of days, on a constrained set of desirable
  placements.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Potentially negative) difference between
  purchase order price and cumulative bidding costs represent agent's
  earnings.

  <emph>Work Performed</emph>
  Convened working group of advertisers, bidding manaagers, data
  engineers, and product managers; then, designed technical roadmap
  for replacing manually-calibrated, human-supervised, fixed-strategy
  bidding agents with data-driven, self-managing, adaptive, autonomous
  agents built on artificial intelligence technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Built and tested production system; worked with operations engineers
  and account executives to deploy on live exchange.

<div class="project-step">
  <emph>Outcome</emph> Bidding agents discovered and exploited hidden
  features of worldwide ad exchanges, most prominently a fixed-rate
  pacing behavior where majority of bidders ensure smooth delivery of
  ads across time by dividing targeted number of impressions into
  equally-sized allotments for delivery in 5-minute, 15-minute, or
  60-minute windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;(For instance, to evenly deliver
  400,000 impressions over a 100-hour period, agents are ordered to
  win 4,000 auctions per hour, or perhaps 1,000 every fifteen
  minutes.)

  <strong>Depicted above</strong>: Horizontal axis represents passage
  of time over a 90 minute interval; variously colored points
  represent winning bids for different bidding strategies; vertical
  axis represents price of winning bid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Key observation is
  that due to implementation of pacing behavior across the world,
  almost 90% of bids on the exchange occur within the first minutes of
  every quarter-hour time block, as agents rush to meet their
  scheduled allotment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, they are in unnecessary
  contention and pay much higher prices per impression than if they
  waited.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at the tail end of each fifteen-minute
  period there are already no more bidders; adaptive bidding agents
  exploited this dynamic to win repeated auctions at the mimimum bid
  price.&nbsp;&nbsp;(For instance, thousands of agents are all bidding
  to meet their block goals at 9:00, 9:15, 9:30, and 9:45 AM, but by
  9:04, 9:19, 9:34 and 9:49 nobody on the internet is seeing ads
  because bidders have exhausted their allotments and are idling until
  the next period.)
  <br><br> Average cost improvement of 42% on exchange representing
  roughly $100M revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Larger image depicting full
  24-hour period available for download below.)
