  <emph>Setting</emph>
  Clients developing GPU-enhanced video camera need an onboard
  facial recognition platform to realize multiple applications.
</div>

<br>

<div class="project-step">
  <emph>Requirements</emph>
  Processing and memory are constrained by camera hardware; software
  can be trained offline but must provide application services in real
  time:
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	In access control setting, camera compares live video of a
	person seeking entry with stored ID photo.
      </li>
      <li>
	In detection setting, platform uses person of interest's photo
	to search streaming video for matches.
      </li>
      <li>
	Additionally, client requires original research into novel
	capabilities that will differentiate product from existing
	state of the art.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<div class="project-step">
  <emph>Work Performed</emph>
  Evaluated publically-available convolutional neural networks for
  facial recognition, then trained custom networks to resolve
  shortcomings on client data; designed additional features in
  response to unanticipated problems and opportunities:
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Secondary classification feature allows platform to learn from
	mistakes and prevent repeated misclassification due to
	difficult images, classes of images, and environmental
	conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
	Object tracking feature extends single-image processing to
	follow the trajectory of an object across multiple frames of
	video.
      </li>
      <li>
	Attribute prediction system, given single photo of a person,
	can predict consumer preferences, ad conversion rate, and
	demographic orientation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

	</a>
	in religious art, either as Dizang in China, or Jizo in Japan;
	two large composite faces uncover underlying structure of each
	embodiment.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="project-step">
  <emph>Outcome</emph>
  In limited deployment, secondary classifier reduces repeat
  mislabeling to 0.001%; object tracker matches state of the art
  assessed by public competition; attribute predictor more than
  quadruples conversion rate in test setting, and achieves 81%
  accuracy in predicting whether a Twitter user is a follower of
  Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton based solely on their user photo.
