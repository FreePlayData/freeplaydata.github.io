  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      Freeplay Data is a consulting service available on a contract
      basis to provide artificial intelligence solutions in the
      general areas of machine learning, data science, vision, natural
      language processing, planning and scheduling, and predictive
      analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freeplay consists of one principal employee,
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eihsu"
	 target="_blank">Eric Hsu</a>,
      and maintains the capability of staffing additional experts
      according to project requirements.

<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">What kinds of problems does Freeplay solve?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      In the abstract, Freeplay is well-suited for any problem where a
      business (or consumer, or client, or government institution)
      faces a regular series of decisions among multiple courses of
      action, perhaps with incomplete information, and it is valuable
      to optimize the overall outcome over the long run, even as the optimal
      choices are constantly changing with the
      environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Concrete examples might include:
      forecasting sales and managing inventory based on historical data
      and real-time indicators; recommending products or services that
      are most likely to interest an individual consumer based on
      online data; finding workflow or supply chain inefficiencies
      using sensors and transactions data; or optimizing the flow of
      traffic through a city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, an artificial intelligence company like Freeplay
      can enable new products and capabilities based on advancing
      modalities like machine vision and natural language
      interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, such techniques can be
      used to predict what types of products someone prefers by
      studying their photos, or to detect fraud or plagiarism by
      analyzing patterns of speech or writing.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">How can Freeplay solve my problem?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      Freeplay can provide a wide range of services, ranging over:
      advising a new organization on technical architecture and the
      search for talent; learning an enterprise line of business and
      conducting a study or analysis in support of current operations
      or technology roadmap; evaluating off-the-shelf methods to develop
      proof-of-concept implementations for new features and products;
      and, developing custom algorithms and systems to solve problems
      and take opportunities that have not been attempted before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because our memership is not only academically trained but has
      some industrial experience working on legitimate large-scale,
      highly-available, distributed
      <a href="https://bespokevideoproduction.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/brightroll-video-network-climbs-to-1-in-video-ad-ranking/"
      target="_blank">
	production systems
      </a>,
      Freeplay has the ability to remaining cognizant of real-world
      test and deployment considerations while conducting research and
      development, and can also work together with clients on the
      implementation part of the integration process.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, no form of collaboration is unworthy of
      consideration; for most cases, though, the simplest initial
      partnership is most likely a study or a prototype and demo.

  <div class="faq-q">What are Freeplay Data's specific areas of expertise?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      With sufficient time, Freeplay is capable of evaluating,
      improving, and delivering essentially any published Artificial
      Intelligence technology in solving a client's concrete problem.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;
      This competence is based on the principal's long and varied
      experience across multiple areas of AI, and the ability to
      solicit guidance from many of the most influential AI
      practitioners in academia and industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a more expedient scenario, Freeplay can rely on existing
      experience to pragmatically deliver solutions using statistical
      modelling and prediction,
      supervised/semi-supervised/unsupervised machine learning (to
      include up-to-date familiarity
      with neural network techniques and packages), reinforcement
      learning and control, automated planning and scheduling (to
      include combinatorial optimization), and decision
      theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;To a lesser extent, Freeplay is also able to
      rely on publically available packages and data to perform
      natural language processing or to design sensor
      networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, though, software systems are a
      stronger internal capability than hardware systems, and thus areas like
      robotics and internet-of-things would require learning on the
      job and/or additional staffingere's
      no job that's we won't consider!
    </p>
    <p>
      Most generally, though, the opportunity to work as partners in
      developing a deep understanding of a specific business area,
      then defining an entirely new capability in this area, and ultimately
      creating a novel solution drawn from a deep understanding of
      existing techinques, is an understandably under-appreciated
      form of collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;Freeplay appreciates the unwieldly
      nature of defining and requesting features that are not known to
      exist, and that for even the most extravagantly
      technology-driven organizations the bottom line calls for
      transaction even as investors, the public, and destiny clamor
      for transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we are willing to work on
      anything that provides value, but it is the chance
      to partner in understaning a business and identifying
      opportunities for innovation that take best advantage of
      Freeplay's most distinguishing competencies.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">What is Freeplay's key distinguishing form of expertise?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      By the self-assessment of its principal, Eric Hsu, Freeplay's
      most distinguishing competence lies in combining a deep and
      independent understanding of traditionally academic artificial
      intelligence techniques with a similarly deep understanding of
      its increasingly industrial application areas, to work with
      partners in inventing new products and capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such depth of experience produces strong informed opinions
      about AI (for instance, that "machine learning is really about
      modelling and optimization, and the vast majority of
      publications, even those that present modelling as a key
      contribution, are really about incremental improvements in
      optimization, while few are able contribute a signficant
      innovation in modelling.") and business (like, that "the true
      focus of automation in industry has not been on productivity or
      scale or human betterment but the market incentive to commodify
      labor-based processes into technology-based assets for
      investment; you can make some money by working or employing
      people but you can only earn arbitrarily large multiples from a
      sector by owning something.")&nbsp;&nbsp;Such ideological
      insights, in addition to appearing unduly presumptuous when stated
      thusly, are neither entirely original and unique, within their
      subject areas, nor widely accepted or even
      tolerated.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in subjects of intense recent or
      longstanding interest such as high technology, artificial
      intelligence, and making money, such a historical
      perspective&mdash;however subjective&mdash;can be critical
      in overcoming hype and superficial understanding to identify
      true opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less abstractly, one more founder's opinion is that he is
      "absolutely positive" that he is the world's #1 expert on a
      particular way of

<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">Is Freeplay familiar with Technology X or

  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      Freeplay is confident in its ability to use the best tool for
      any job, to include expeditiously evaluating new frameworks, or
      learning new languages as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, clients may
      have legacy requirements that affect the consideration of what
      is the best tool for the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind it
      may be worth noting that the main areas of past
      experience center on Scala, Java, Python, C/C++, Lisp, Ruby, and
      Matlab implementations running on Unix-type operating systems,
      to include various software frameworks like Spark, Pig, Hadoop,
      Kafka, Oozie, various Message-Queing sytems like ZeroMQ, NoSQL
      implementations like MongoDB, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas of lesser
      experience would include development for Windows and Android or
      for proprietary platforms like Salesforce or Oracle.

  <div class="faq-q">What is the origin of the company?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      As of December 2017, Freeplay Data is a brand new business!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      The company has only one member, Eric Hsu&mdash;he has twenty-plus
      years of experience applying Artificial Intelligence
      techniques to specific problems in the start-up, enterprise, and
      government research sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      (A history of previous positions is listed on
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eihsu"
	 target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary assumption in founding this company is that
      external clients will present unique, challenging, and
      well-defined problems, but will not always have the appropriate
      requirements for internal staffing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      For Freeplay, this is also a way to ensure access to projects
      with high-impact outcomes, strong commitment from the business,
      and well-defined timelines, in comparison to working as an
      internal employee for a single firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;For more
      technology-driven organizations, the ideal relationship would
      include even the opportunity to collaborate on defining new
      capabilities and inventing new solutions that do not yet exist
      anywhere in a given industry.

<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">What are your rates?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      Freeplay will work on a contract basis, with rates dependent on
      the nature of the project; please
      <a href="index.html#contact">
	get in touch
      </a>
      to work out a project-specific estimate!&nbsp;&nbsp;
      One rule of thumb is that a new feature or study should cost
      about as much as a car&mdash;a used or low-performance stock car
      may have very little cost, and is sometimes enough to get the
      job done; custom or exotic cars designed to high performance
      standards may be many times more valuable and
      costly.&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, advice is free!
